Description: G2P is an integrated R toolkit to facilitate genotype-to-phenotype prediction for GS in crops. The G2P toolkit accepts multiple formats of input genotypic and phenotypic data, and provides a comprehensive set of analysis functions for quality control, filtration and training/test data formulation. G2P incorporates 16 state-of-the-art GS methods and 13 evaluation metrics, thereby decreasing coding burden and increasing flexibility for model construction, optimization, evaluation.
